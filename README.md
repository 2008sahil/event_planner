This is an Event Planner web application designed to help users plan and schedule events. The app allows users to create events, set their schedules, and receive automatic notifications when the event time occurs.

- **Event Creation**: Users can create events and define their schedule.
- **Automatic Notifications**: The app will automatically notify the user when the event time occurs.
- **Responsive Interface**: The frontend is designed to be responsive and user-friendly.
